# HandPong

Classical Pong game with hand controls based on Google's MediaPipe

## Overview

HandPong is an interactive version of the classic Pong arcade game that uses computer vision to detect hand movements for controlling the paddles. Instead of using keyboard inputs, players can move their hands in front of a webcam to control the game, creating a more immersive and physically engaging experience.

## Requirements

- Webcam
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled (Chrome recommended)
- Sufficient lighting for hand detection
